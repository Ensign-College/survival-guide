If you are looking at this page, you are using Canvas right now! There are a few main functions that you can use Canvas for:

//     dashboard.png Dashboard. This is the default view that you see when you first log onto Canvas with. You can use the Dashboard to see all of your classes. You can use the three dots in the corner to change the primary dashboard view between card, list, and recent activity views.

//     calendar.png Calendar. With the Calendar view, you can see all your assignments and other notifications from canvas for a specific view type. The Default view is on month, but you can select weekly and daily views as well. Please note that it is tempting to only rely on the calendar for assignments. This is a mistake. Make sure you check all the assigned material in Canvas by going to the Modules section.
